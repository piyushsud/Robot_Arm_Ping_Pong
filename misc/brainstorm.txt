# problem: how to know when to start/change trajectory estimation? e.g during serve ball is thrown up, then hit, but only want to estimate
# trajectory after hit
#
# solution 1 : always estimate trajectory. significant change in trajectory = paddle or table hit ball, restart trajectory estimation
#
# solution 2: listen to sound of ball hitting paddle, when hear sound, start trajectory estimation
#
# solution 3: detect paddle, when in contact start trajectory estimation
#
# solution 4: detect motion using pixel subtraction between subsequent frames. Use that to find location of ball. When
# ball velocity is to the left at a certain speed or greater, start trajectory estimation
#
# solution 4 is probably the best?

how to find ball position given blurred ball?

8 direction: up, up and to the right, right, down and to the right, down, down and to the left, left, up and to the left
use center of bbox to find direction
what about if blur changes? general direction should still be similar
